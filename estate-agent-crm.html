                    <p>The best CRM for real estate agents isn't just a database of contacts. It's a system that actively helps you win more business by automating the tasks that slow you down.</p>
                    <p>A great estate agent CRM should:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Capture leads automatically</strong> - Pull enquiries from Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket, and your website without manual entry</li>
                        <li><strong>Follow up instantly</strong> - Respond to landlord enquiries within seconds, not hours</li>
                        <li><strong>Score and prioritise leads</strong> - Know which landlords are most valuable and focus your time accordingly</li>
                        <li><strong>Schedule viewings</strong> - Coordinate availability without endless back-and-forth emails</li>
                        <li><strong>Track the entire journey</strong> - From first enquiry to move-in, see every interaction in one place</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Lettings Quest adds AI automation to all of these features, so your CRM actually does the work instead of just storing data.</p>
