                    <h2>What is AI Lead Generation for Real Estate?</h2>
                    <p>AI lead generation for real estate uses artificial intelligence to automate the entire process of capturing, qualifying, and nurturing landlord and tenant leads. Instead of manually responding to enquiries, AI handles the initial contact and qualification so you can focus on high-value conversations.</p>
                    <p>With AI lead generation, real estate agents can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Respond to enquiries in seconds</strong> - AI replies to portal and website enquiries instantly, even at 2am on a Sunday</li>
                        <li><strong>Qualify leads automatically</strong> - AI asks the right questions to identify serious landlords vs tyre-kickers</li>
                        <li><strong>Score leads by value</strong> - Know which leads to prioritise based on property value, portfolio size, and engagement</li>
                        <li><strong>Nurture cold leads</strong> - Automated follow-up sequences keep you top of mind until landlords are ready to instruct</li>
                        <li><strong>Never miss an opportunity</strong> - Every single enquiry gets a response, so no leads fall through the cracks</li>
